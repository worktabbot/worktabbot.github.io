Work Tab Bot

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application to clean up horse racing worktab data.

You paste the HTML pull from Google Sheets into the form. It updates to follow style rules, scrub sponsors, and order by class (and then by ABC).

Then, you can just copy, paste, and write the work tab introduction. It's meant to be quick, easy, and save hours of manually looking for style deviations.

No frills...well, except for the clear button, which only exists because the bottom field is read-only and it drives me nuts when not to be able to clear it.
